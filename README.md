    <h3>Dumpling</h3>
    <p>A simple, all-in-one Wii U file dumper! Developed with the intent of making dumping games and other files (for emulators like Cemu) faster and easier</p>
</div>

## How to install
**Method 1:**  
Use the Wii U App Store to download and install it in the homebrew launcher. See Dumpling's page [here](https://apps.fortheusers.org/wiiu/dumpling).

**Method 2:**  
Download the [latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/emiyl/dumpling/releases), and extract the `dumpling.zip` file to the root of your SD card.

**Method 3:**  
Use [dumplingapp.com](https://dumplingapp.com) on your Wii U to launch Dumpling without any setup or SD card.

## How to use

For an always up-to-date guide to dump your games for Cemu using Dumpling, see [cemu.cfw.guide](https://cemu.cfw.guide/dumping-games)!  

If you want to fully homebrew your Wii U too, we recommend using [wiiu.hacks.guide](https://wiiu.hacks.guide) to install Tiramisu and installing Dumpling using the first two methods mentioned above!

You don't need to run/have Mocha CFW or Haxchi, just launch Dumpling from the Homebrew Launcher.

## How to compile
 - Install [DevkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) for your platform.
 - Install freetype2 using DevkitPro's pacman (e.g. `(dkp-)pacman -Sy ppc-pkg-config ppc-freetype`).
 - Install wiiu-curl using DevkitPro's pacman (e.g. `(dkp-)pacman -Sy wiiu-curl`)
 - Install [wut](https://github.com/devkitpro/wut) through DevkitPro's pacman or compile (and install) the latest source yourself.
 - Compile [libmocha](https://github.com/wiiu-env/libmocha).
 - Then, with all those dependencies installed, you can just run `make` to get the .rpx file that you can run on your Wii U.
